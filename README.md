To use effectively:
 - Use the command `python3 chatbot_gui.py` to start the program.
 - To change modes, use the `mode one line` or `mode default` commands to switch to One Line (writes code one line at a time) or Default mode (multi-line code generation) respectively.
 - To generate python code, use the `maestro` command and say what you want coded in natural language. The code will be generated in the text editor.
 - the `stop` command will stop a running program.
 - the `exit` command will close the application.
 - You can clear terminal and text editor using the `clear` command. if you say `clear terminal`, only the terminal will be cleared. If you say `clear editor`, only the text editor will be cleared.
 - To save the code, use the `save` command. The code will be saved in a file named `untitled.py` (will change in future versions if necessary).
 - To open a file, use the `open` command. The file will be opened in the text editor.
 - the `run` command will run the code in the text editor.
 - the `stop` command will stop a running program.
